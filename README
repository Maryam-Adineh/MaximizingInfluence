To compile:
	make InfluenceMaximization
	
To execute:
	./InfluenceMaximization <AAPC|EAPC> <dataset> <d|u> <p> <k> <R>
	
	<AAPC|EAPC>
		Algorithm name introduced in the paper.
	<dataset>
		Path of dataset file. An example of file format is described in the following.	
	<d|u>
		'd' for directed graph file and 'u' for undirected.
	<p>
		Propagation probability of IC model. A number in [0,1].
	<k>
		Size of the seed set.
	<R>
		Number of simulations to calculate influnce spread.
		
example:
	./InfluenceMaximization remove graph.txt d 0.01 2 1000

graph.txt:
5 10  => #n #m: Number of vertices and edges
0 1  \
0 2   \
1 3    => #m line of edges(source target)
. .   /
. .  /

output:
	Three files will be created for selected seeds, execution time and influence spread.
